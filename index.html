<p>Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. 
   Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998),
    Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters.
     These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following
      distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.In 2001, 
      he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi.
      Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.

       and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013),
        Gopala Gopala (2015), Vakeel Saab (2021), and Bheemla Nayak (2022).

         Telugu film of its era.</p>
